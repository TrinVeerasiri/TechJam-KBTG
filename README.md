This is hackathon. We are team of 2 persons. The competition has 2 rounds. First round, 5 questions are given and has to solve in 3 days. The data is a transaction. We must use the transaction to predict such as churn prediction, gender prediction from credit card. The 3 best scores will be use to evaluate the performance of each team. Me and my friend start from cleaning the data then apply model such as Neural network and LightGBM. We are 1 of 25 finalists.

The final problem is to utilize credit card information and transactions to determine buying behavior of all the customers. The given data dates from January 2016 to June 2017. The goal is to predict amount of spending and buying frequency of five designated categories in July 2017. We have 12 hours to implement the model. We use Neural network and LightGBM. We are not the winner. The rank is not reveal.
